    "description": "Time-series of field-aligned current (FAC) and radial current (IRC) densities along the orbit using the dual-satellite local least-squares (LLS) method. IRC density is obtained by applying the Ampere's law on four-point configurations, formed along the orbit by combining satellite positions from Swarm A and Swarm C. IRC density is provided along the whole orbit, except in the region close to the orbital cross-point, when the geometry of the four-point configurations becomes too elongated (i.e. for absolute values in latitude > approx. 86.6° during Swarm nominal orbit configuration). The FAC density, derived from IRC density by considering the local inclination of the magnetic field, can only be calculated at latitudes where the geomagnetic field inclination is > 30° or < - 30°.\n\nNote: to minimize the influence of small-scale fluctuations at each satellite and to match the scale of the magnetic perturbations with the configuration scale, the magnetic field data is filtered with a Butterworth, order 5, 20 s cut-off low-pass filter.",
